# ðŸ¤– CrewAI Framework Exploration

This repository contains my learning notebook on the CrewAI agentic framework, an open-source system designed to coordinate and automate tasks through intelligent multi-agent collaboration.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand how CrewAI enables multiple agents to:
- Collaborate dynamically
- Make decisions autonomously
- Execute complex reasoning pipelines
- Integrate seamlessly with LLMs, APIs, and external tools

This notebook demonstrates:
- Defining custom AI agents with specific roles
- Creating a "Crew" (a team of agents)
- Assigning tasks and orchestrating workflows
- Observing agent collaboration and output generation
